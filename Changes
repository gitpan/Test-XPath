Revision history for Perl extension Test::XPath.

0.11  2009-09-04T22:16:11
      - Edited the documentation for accuracy, grammar, etc.
      - Added `not_ok()`.
      - Updated minimum Test::More requirement to 0.70. Sometime between 0.64
        and 0.70, the format of diagnostics changed, so older versions make
        Test::XPath tests fail.

0.10  2009-08-31T21:34:37
      - Initial version.
